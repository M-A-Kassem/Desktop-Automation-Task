Vision-Based Desktop Automation

A simple Python script that:

Detects the Notepad desktop icon using template matching.

Fetches the first 10 posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.

Opens Notepad automatically.

Pastes each post’s content.

Saves it as post_{id}.txt on the Desktop.

Repeats for all posts.

In short:
A vision-based bot that opens Notepad and automatically writes and saves data from an API.
